# Java Interview

This repo contains some questions for a Java pairing exercise.
There are three questions in total.
It is *not* expected that you would complete all three questions within the interview time.

The aim is to get a feel of how you might go about solving problems.
We hope that you find this to be an enjoyable exercise.
